BUILD

1)identificationKeyAPI -> run as -> maven assembly or maven package or maven install
-> generates a single .jar file named identificationKeyAPI-1.x.jar


2)Copy the jar file into the Webcontent/WEB-INF/lib folders of the webservice project (IK_WS_REST or IK_WS_SOAP)


3)Copy the sigar libraries into the Webcontent/WEB-INF/lib folders of the webservice project (IK_WS_REST or IK_WS_SOAP)


4)IK_WS_SOAP or IK_WS_REST -> run as -> maven assembly or maven package
-> generates a .war file (named IK_WS_SOAP-1.x.war or IK_WS_SOAP-1.x.war) for the selected web wervice project


DEPLOYMENT

1)IK_WS_SOAP or IK_WS_REST -> put the WAR file in the Tomcat/webapps/ directory


2)Start the server


3)Stop server and put a new confOverridable.properties file in Tomcat/webapps/IK_WS_REST-1.0/WEB-INF/classes/main/resources/ directory (if the directories do not exist create it manually).
This file must contain (change parameters if necessary) :

# The two parameters below determine where the files created by the
# WebService will be located on the host server file system
generatedKeyFiles.prefix = webapps/
generatedKeyFiles.folder = generatedKeyFiles/
# the property below sets the delay (in seconds) after which any
# file generated by the WebService is deleted
# 2592000 is the number of second for 30 days.
generatedKeyFiles.delete.period = 2592000
host = http://yourServerHost:8080/
# the following property may contain any message you want, that indicates
# who generated the identification key (typically, your institution)
message.createdBy = created by *placeholder*
# Email address for assistance
email.webmaster = yourwebm@steremail.com


4)To restrict the access to the application you can add the following parameters in the <host> tag in the server.xml file of tomcat:

<Context path="/ApplicationName" docBase="/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ApplicationName" workDir="/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ApplicationName">
  <Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve" allow="134.157.*.*" deny=""/>
</Context>


5)Start the server
